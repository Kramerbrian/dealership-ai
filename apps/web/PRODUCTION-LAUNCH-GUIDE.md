## üéØ Launch Sequence (Execute in Order)

### Step 1: AWS Infrastructure Setup (30-60 minutes)

**1.1 Configure AWS Credentials**
```bash
# Install and configure AWS CLI
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1), and output format (json)
```

**1.2 Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
# Deploy complete AWS infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-aws-infrastructure.sh

# This will create:
# - VPC with public/private subnets
# - Application Load Balancer with SSL
# - Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances
# - RDS PostgreSQL database
# - ElastiCache Redis cluster
# - CloudWatch monitoring & alerts
# - S3 backup bucket
# - Route53 DNS and SSL certificates
```

**1.3 Configure Domain**
```bash
# Set up domain and SSL certificates
DOMAIN_NAME=yourdomain.com ./scripts/setup-domain.sh
```

### Step 2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (15-30 minutes)

**2.1 GitHub Repository Setup**
```bash
# Set up GitHub secrets for CI/CD
REPO_OWNER=yourusername REPO_NAME=dealership-ai ./scripts/setup-secrets.sh
```

**2.2 Configure Secrets**
The script will prompt for:
- AWS credentials
- NextAuth secret and URL
- AI API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Google OAuth credentials (optional)
- Sentry DSN (optional)
- Slack webhook URL (optional)

### Step 3: Environment Configuration (10-15 minutes)

**3.1 Production Environment File**
```bash
# Copy the generated AWS configuration
cp .env.production.aws .env.production

# Edit .env.production with your specific values:
# - Add your API keys
# - Configure Google OAuth
# - Set up Sentry DSN
# - Add any custom configuration
```

**3.2 Database Setup**
```bash
# The infrastructure script automatically:
# - Creates RDS PostgreSQL instance
# - Sets up secure database password in AWS SSM
# - Configures connection string in environment
```

### Step 4: Application Deployment (15-30 minutes)

**4.1 Build and Deploy**
```bash
# Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
git add .
git commit -m "üöÄ Production launch: Complete infrastructure setup"
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger deployment via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run production-deploy.yml
```

**4.2 Monitor Deployment**
- Watch GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/yourusername/dealership-ai/actions`
- Monitor AWS CloudWatch: Generated dashboard URL
- Check application health: `https://yourdomain.com/api/health`

### Step 5: DNS and Domain Configuration (5-15 minutes)

**5.1 Update Domain Records**
```bash
# Get the Load Balancer DNS from AWS
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name dealershipai-production \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`LoadBalancerDNS`].OutputValue' \
  --output text

# Point your domain to the Load Balancer DNS:
# Create A record (or CNAME) in your domain registrar
# yourdomain.com -> your-load-balancer-dns.amazonaws.com
```

### Step 6: Verification and Testing (10-20 minutes)

**6.1 Health Checks**
```bash
# Application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Database connectivity
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health | jq '.database'

# Authentication system
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/providers
```

**6.2 Functional Testing**
- [ ] Main application loads: `https://yourdomain.com`
- [ ] User registration/login works
- [ ] Dashboard displays correctly for each role
- [ ] AI chat functionality works
- [ ] Analytics and reporting functional
- [ ] Admin features accessible

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Failures

**GitHub Actions Fails**
```bash
# Check logs in GitHub Actions tab
# Common issues:
# - AWS permissions
# - Missing secrets

# Debug locally:
pnpm run build
pnpm run lint
pnpm run type-check
```

**SSL Certificate Issues**
```bash
# Check certificate status
aws acm list-certificates --region us-east-1

# Verify DNS validation
nslookup _acme-challenge.yourdomain.com
```

**Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check RDS instance
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier dealershipai-production-postgres

# Test connection from EC2
psql -h your-db-endpoint -U dealershipai -d dealershipai_prod
```

### Application Issues

**500 Errors**
